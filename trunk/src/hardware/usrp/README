A gHPSDR3 compliant server for USRP hardware using UHD - Universal Hardware Driver API.

The server program in the ghpsdr3 suite of programs is the the program 
that forms the interface to the hardware.  One instance of this program 
must be running to communicate with the USRP hardware.

Currently the server program is a command line program and it has several options.

--receivers [1|2|3|4]

  receivers (note the plural) is the number of simultaneous receiver you 
want to monitor from your receiver card.  the use of this option is 
dependent on the version of the FPGA code you are using.  All versions 
support one receiver.  Bruce Walkers FPGA code supports 4 receivers.
Default is 1.

NOTE: at the current stage, the usrp-server supports only 1 receiver

--samplerate | -s [48000|96000|192000]

  samplerate is the rate at which you want the usrp-server to provide baseband 
signal samples to its client (dspserver).  Default is 48000.
Note that RX samplerate from USRP is fixed to 256 KSPS.  Alteration of USRP sample rate 
is not available at this stage and may be part of future enhancements.

--rx-subdev | -r SUBDEV_STRING

--tx-subdev | -t SUBDEV_STRING
 
  subdevice options allow to select the USRP daughter board as receiver and transmitter front
end. Please refer to UHD documentation for valid selections by SUBDEV_STRING.
(http://files.ettus.com/uhd_docs/manual/html/general.html#specifying-the-subdevice-to-use)
Default is "", meaning that UHD will automatically select the first available receiver 
or transmitter front-end among USRP A and B sides.

--txmod-to [usrp|card]

  txmod-to option allows selecting the destination of TX path audio IQ samples.
'usrp' option directs TX IQ samples to USRP
'card' option directs TX IQ samples to the default audio card
Default id 'usrp'. This option is for testing purposes.
  
--reverse-iq

  reverse-iq option, if specified, swaps I and Q streams from the USRP.
Usually is not needed, may be useful for specific applications

--disable-path [rx|tx]

  disable-path option, if specified, drops samples of the selectd path.
If 'rx' is selected, no sample is sent to the client (dspserver)
If 'tx' is selected, audio samples arriving from the client (dspserver) are dropped 
and not forwarded to the USRP. This option is for testing purposes.

1. BUILD

  To build the server, several prerequisite have to be fullfilled.


1.1 UHD - Universal Hardware Driver installation

  Extract the code from the git repository:
$ cd
$ git clone git://code.ettus.com/ettus/uhd.git

  that results in a uhd directory being created in your home.

  For the build, please refer to procedure available from the Ettus site:
  http://www.ettus.com/uhd_docs/manual/html/build.html#build-instructions-unix

  Next, you have to download the FPGA's images and firmware for microntroller embedded into USRP1.
  The procedure is specified in:
       http://www.ettus.com/uhd_docs/manual/html/images.html

  Assuming Ubuntu platfom, download the binary image:
  
$ wget http://www.ettus.com/downloads/uhd_images/UHD-images-0001.20101214004901.3ed60b6/UHD-images-0001.20101214004901.3ed60b6-Linux.deb

  and install it:

$ sudo dpkg -i UHD-images-0001.20101214004901.3ed60b6-Linux.deb

  After the installations above are successfully ended, several utility and test program are available in ~/uhd/host/build/examples/
  Use 
  
$ uhd_find_devices --args="type=usrp1"

  to test your USRP and UHD installation.
  Use rx_samples_to_file to verify the end to end working of the platform.

2 HOW TO RUN

We have to run three components: server, dsp processing and graphical user interface.
At the moment you need to run them in three separate terminal windows in the order shown below:

$ ./usrp_server -r "A:0" -t "A:0"

$ /usr/local/bin/dspserver

$ /usr/local/bin/QtRadio


1.4 Troubleshooting

1.4.1 usrp_server complains about the libuhd shared library.

Please run 

sudo ldconfig
