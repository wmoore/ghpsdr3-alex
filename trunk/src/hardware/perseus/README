0. Perseus server
=================

An attempt to write a I/Q server for Microtelecom Perseus HF Receiver.


The code was derived from John Melton G0ORX/N6LYT code for HPSDR Ozymandias card.
The code uses the REL-0.4 release of libperseus-sdr (written by Nico Palermo IN3NWV), see below for 
preresite installation.
The glue code has been written by Andrea Montefusco, IW0HDV andrew att montefusco dott com.

A server program in the ghpsdr3 suite of programs is the program 
that forms the interface to the hardware.  One instance of this program 
must be running to communicate with the USRP hardware.

Currently the perseus-server program is a command line program and it has several options.

/perseus_server -h
Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                    print usage message
  -d [ --debug ] arg (=0)          debug level
  -r [ --receivers ] arg (=1)      # of receivers
  -s [ --samplerate ] arg (=95000) samplerate (95000 | 125000 | 250000 )
  -t [ --dither ] arg (=0)         dither on|off
  -p [ --preamp ] arg (=0)         preamplifier on|off
  -z [ --randomizer ] arg (=0)     randomizer on|off




1. PREREQUISITE
===============

To build the server, several prerequisites have to be fullfilled.


Install the libperseus-sdr found on http://code.google.com/p/libperseus-sdr/source/checkout.
Please use the release 0.4:

cd
svn co  http://libperseus-sdr.googlecode.com/svn/tags/REL-0.4 perseus-r0.4
cd perseus-r0.4
./configure
make
sudo make install

Read the perseus-r0.4/README for preliminary tests.


Next install the remaining prerequisite:

sudo apt-get install libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev libsamplerate0 libsamplerate0-dev
sudo apt-get install git-core
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-3
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

If using more recent distributions (with Qt 4.7 in binary packages):

sudo apt-get install qtmobility-dev

2. BUILD
========


2.1 Extract and build this package
----------------------------------

  Untar this package into your home directory:

  cd ~
  tar -zxvf ~/Download/perseus-hpsdr.tgz
  cd perseus-hpsdr
  make

To compile on Linux (test done on Ubuntu Linux 10.04):

  make


2.2 Preliminary test
--------------------

To run the server you have to submit 

  $ sudo ./perseus_server
  DEBUG:      0
  SAMPLERATE: 95000
  RECEIVER:   1
  DITHER:     0
  PREAMP:     0
  RANDOMIZER: 0
  1 Perseus receiver found
  Listening for TCP connections on port 11000

The server looks for an attached (and turned on) Perseus receiver BUT doesn't activate it.



2.3 gpsdr3 package from John Melton
-----------------------------------


  To install the package do the following steps:
  
  cd
  svn co svn://svn.openhpsdr.org/svn/repos_sdr_hpsdr/trunk/N6LYT/ghpsdr3 ghpsdr3-new 
  cd ~/ghpsdr3-new/trunk/src/

  cd DttSP/
  make 
  cd ../dspserver
  patch < ~/perseus-hpsdr/dspserver.patches
  make

  cd ../QtRadio
  # Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
  patch < ~/perseus-hpsdr/QtRadio.patches
  #
  # Warning: on Ubuntu 10.10 and in general on distributions using Qt 4.7,
  # apply instead the following patch file
  #
  patch < ~/perseus-hpsdr/QtRadio.U10.10.patches

  qmake-qt4 QtRadio.pro
  make


3. RUN
======


We have to run three components: server, dsp processing and graphical user interface.
At the moment you need to run them in three separate terminal windows, strictly in the order shown below:

  ~/perseus-hpsdr/perseus_server 

  ~/ghpsdr3-new/trunk/bin/dspserver

Allows for few seconds delay in order server complete the hardware setup.
At this point you should already ear 

  cd ~/ghpsdr3-new/trunk/src/QtRadio ; export QT_RADIO_NO_LOCAL_AUDIO=1 ; ./QtRadio

When the GUI shows up, connect it to the DSP server (Menu Receiver, submenu Connect). 


4. Troubleshooting
==================

4.1 perseus-server complains about the libperseus-sdr shared library missing.

Run 

sudo ldconfig


4.2 All the process are up and running but no audio is played

Stop all process and rerun only perseus-server with the debug option activated:

sudo ~/perseus/perseus_server -d3

Next, start in another terminal window the DSP:

~/ghpsdr3/trunk/bin/dspserver

into the perseus-server windows you should see the list of audio devices as seen by portaudio library.
Just before of the big list the server signals what device is using:

default input=12 output=12 devices=14
