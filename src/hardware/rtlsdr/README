0. RTLSDR SERVER
================

This file documents an attempt to write a I/Q server for RTLSDR.
For more information on the hardware, please refer to the web site:

    http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

A server program, in the ghpsdr3 suite, is the program 
that forms the interface to the hardware.  One instance of this program 
must be running to allow the DSP process to communicate with the rtl-sdr hardware.

Currently the rtlsdr-server program is a command line program and it has few options, as follows:
                                       
      -s [ --samplerate ] arg (=250000) samplerate in Samples/second
                                       (250000 | 500000 | 1000000)    
      -g [ --gain ] arg gain in dB
      -h [ --help ]                    print usage message         
      -d [ --debug ] arg (=0)          debug level                 



0.1 Credits and Acknowledgements
--------------------------------

The code base was derived (by Alex Lee 9V1AL et al.) from John Melton G0ORX/N6LYT code for HPSDR Ozymandias card.

The code specific for rtlsdr has been written by Andrea Montefusco, IW0HDV (andrew att montefusco dott com),
thanks to the invaluable support by DL6KBG Oliver Goldenstein, that provided his dongles, Linux PC and Internet connection for the development.

Many thanks too to osmocosmo guys that wrote the precious llibrtlsdr library (sources found at http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/rtl-sdr/) that takes care of all gory details in order to manage the device.


0.2 Caveats
-----------

The code here described as to be regarded as highly experimental. Please reports bugs and suggestions on sdr-widget mailing list.



1. PREREQUISITE
===============

To build the server, you have to donwload and build the rtl-sdr library.

cd
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
cd rtl-sdr/
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
sudo ldconfig
sudo make install



2. RUN
======

We have to run three components: server, dsp processing and graphical user interface.
At the moment you need to run them in three separate terminal windows, strictly in the order shown below:

xterm -e 'rtlsdr-server -d3 -s96000' &
xterm -e 'dspserver --lo 0' &
QtRadio &

When the GUI shows up, connect it to the DSP server (Menu Receiver, submenu Connect) and select the
127.0.0.1 (localhost) server address. That if you are running the trhee pieces altogether in the same machine.
Elsewhere  use the IP address of the machine where the dspserver is running.
